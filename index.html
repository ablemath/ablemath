  Able Enrichment Centre (AEC) is a non-profit, volunteer operated, community
  organization where students enrich their knowledge, operating skills and
  interests in mathematics. The main objectives of the centre are; to remove
  the students' fear of mathematics and to reinforce the students' confidence
  to master mathematics. The Centre provides recreational programs, such as
  line dancing, badminton and basket ball games for parents and friends. The
  Centre also provides the opportunity for university students to practice
  their skills in teaching and mentoring younger students.
