Summer camp registration and 2019/2020 program registration information is
provided below.

This summer, the program will be held on Saturdays in July and August, starting
on July 6th. Each day will be three hours long from 1:00-4:00 pm, which is a
great way for students to be introduced into the year-long program in the Fall.
