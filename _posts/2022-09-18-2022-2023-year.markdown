Dear parents and students, we are excited to announce that Able Enrichment will
be running classes for the 2022-23 year.  Please see below our calendar for the
upcoming year, and our registration form.

[2022/2023 Registration Form](/docs/2022/regform.pdf)

Our campus will be at St John's Ravenscourt School. Our classes cater to
students between grades 6 to 12 and cover material up to introductory calculus.

Registrations will take place on Saturday October 1st. All students, both new
and returning, must undergo an assessment **in person** to determine proper class
placement. New student registration will take place between 2-3pm, and
returning students between 3-4pm. As all assessments take time, we ask that
people do not rush in early and spread your arrival out through the hour.

School fees are $360 for the year per student. Those who were registered in
2019-20 will have a credit applied. **Payment via cash or cheque only.**
