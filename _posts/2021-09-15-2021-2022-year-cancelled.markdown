Dear parents and students, we regret to inform you that due to the ongoing
pandemic and concerns for health and safety, Able Enrichment will not be
opening this year.

You may preregister for the 2022-2023 by filling out the following survey:

[Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xaNLHJtNbTXk_SSr8oGk6TpF0mzg3ijwHz9ilj96H9g/viewform)

If you had already preregistered for the 2021-22 year, you do not need to fill
it out again.

At this time we do not have plans to offer lessons online. This past year has
been a difficult time for everyone as interactions have moved online, and we
feel that adding to that stress is contrary to our goals of fostering a healthy
social learning environment.

Thank you for your continued patience, and we hope to see you next year.
