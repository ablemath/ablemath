Thank you all for your continued patience during this time. Due to the closure
of the third term of our 2019-2020 school year, Able Enrichment is prepared to
offer one of the following refund choices:

1. A refund of $120 to be sent by cheque; -OR-
2. Carry over the remainder of the year's fees and preregister for next year,
   with a balance of $200 to be paid at registration (an effective discount of
   $160)

Note that due to the ongoing pandemic, we do not yet know when the school will
reopen. We will alert all preregistered parents when we receive more information
from the school and provincial authorities.

Please fill out the following form to make your selection. The offer will close
at the end of the day on Tuesday, June 30, 2020.
