Dear parents and students, we are excited to announce that Able Enrichment will
be running classes for the 2023-24 year.  Please see below our calendar for the
upcoming year, and our registration form.

[2023/2024 Registration Form](/docs/2023/regform.pdf)

Our campus will be at St John's Ravenscourt School. Our classes cater to
students between grades 6 to 12 and cover material up to introductory calculus.

Registrations will take place on Saturday September 16. New students must
undergo an assessment **in person** to determine proper class placement. New
student registration will take place between 2-3pm, and returning students
between 3-4pm. As all assessments take time, we ask that people do not rush in
early and spread your arrival out through the hour.

School fees are $360 for the year per student.
